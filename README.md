# getWeather

This Python program uses JSON to print the weather for a location from OpenWeatherMap.org's API.

To make this program work for you:

1. Create an account at: https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up
2. Generate an API key on the following page and paste into the program: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
3. Paste the longitude and latitude of your current location into the program.
4. Choose an API and paste the URL into the program: https://openweathermap.org/api
5. Run "python getWeather.py" in your console. 

You can customize the weather information you want. I currently have it displaying today's forecast followed by tomorrow's forecast followed by a general description of the hourly weather for the next 24 hours.

An obvious improvement I might make to this program in the future is to have it email this forecast automatically every morning.
